Make sure to read all comments if something about the code seems confusing.
Remember to install the appropriate port drivers if they are not already installed when downloading tools for the board in Arduino.
This code will not run on Crypto 0.2.0, the version currently available on Arduino's official website (as of the time writing this). If Crypto 0.4.0 is not available there, search for it online and download it directly from Github (Downgit can do this easily).
